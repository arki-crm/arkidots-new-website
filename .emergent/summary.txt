**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Backend Integration for Contact Forms (P0)**
    - All forms across the website (Contact page, service pages, etc.) are currently non-functional and use mock submissions. This is the highest priority task to make the website useful for lead generation.

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1: Backend Integration for Contact Forms**
    - **Attempted fixes:** N/A. This is a new implementation task, not a fix.
    - **Next debug checklist:** This is a feature implementation, not a bug. The plan is:
        1. Define a Pydantic model in  for contact submissions (e.g., ).
        2. Create a new MongoDB collection (e.g., ).
        3. Implement a new POST endpoint (e.g., ) in  to receive form data and save it to the MongoDB collection.
        4. In the frontend, update all components with forms (, , etc.) to replace mock  handlers with an Axios POST request to the new endpoint.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will make the website functional by allowing Arki Dots to receive and store customer inquiries, which is the primary business goal of the site.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?** N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
- **Task 1: Implement Email Notifications on Form Submission (P1)**
    - After backend storage is implemented, the next step is to integrate an email service to send a notification to the company whenever a new form is submitted. This will require using an integration agent to select and implement an email service provider.
    - **File/Method:**  (within the  endpoint).
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Blocked on:** Issue 1: Backend Integration for Contact Forms

- **Styling:** TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI components.
- **Backend:** FastAPI.
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Development:** The entire frontend was built with mock data first, with backend integration planned as a separate, subsequent phase.

**key DB schema**
- **status_checks:**  (This is an existing default collection, not used by the new features).
- **contacts (Proposed):** A schema for contact form submissions will need to be created, likely including fields like , , , , , and .

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
- : All  files within this directory were created during this session to build out the website's pages.
- : Created to provide mock project data for the gallery.
- : Updated multiple times to add routes for all new pages.
- : Updated to add navigation links for About, Contact, and Gallery.
- : Updated to add links for the new policy pages.
- : Updated multiple times to add links to service pages and to insert new sections (How It Works, Why Choose Us advantages).
- : The existing backend server file, which will need to be modified for form submission handling.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The gallery's content is hardcoded in . For scalability, this should be refactored to fetch project data from a MongoDB collection via a new API endpoint.

**key api endpoints**
- : Default health check endpoint.
- : GET/POST endpoints for status checks.
- **(Upcoming)** : A new POST endpoint will be needed to handle all form submissions from the website.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The entire frontend is complete from a visual and structural perspective, but it is not functional for lead capture. All forms are mocked.
- The immediate and highest-priority task is to implement the backend for the contact forms. Do not proceed with any new frontend features until this is done.
- Follow the plan outlined in the All Pending/In progress Issue list to create the contact submission endpoint and connect the frontend forms.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
